    "# 1) Data Collection\n",
    "I am starting off with a data set from Harvard that contains 39.6 million tweets related to climate change. The data set is in tweet IDs (numbers) so I need get the tweets for each tweet ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the link the data set: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/5QCCUU\n",
    "\n",
    "As states in the above link the data is from September 21, 2017 and May 17, 2019 and they had a gap in data collection from January 7, 2019 to April 17, 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert each tweet ID into the actual tweet data I am using this: Hydrator [Computer Software]. Retrieved from https://github.com/docnow/hydrator\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above repo, I downloaded this version of the app: https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator/releases/tag/v0.0.13\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweets are seperated by file (~ 10 million tweets/file). I made a Twitter account to connect my account this Hydrator. I then uploaded each txt file into Hydrator under \"Datasets\" in the desktop app. NOTE: because of API rate limits and the shear number of tweets this will take a long time to get all the tweets. I stores them in a jsonl file for each dataset (which they are 4) that you upload. \n",

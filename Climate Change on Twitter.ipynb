    "I did not go and scrape Twitter to get all tweets that were on climate. Instead, I found a GWU dataset of climate change tweets that were collected from 2017-2019 (Littman, Justin; Wrubel, Laura, 2019, \"Climate Change Tweets Ids\", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5QCCUU, Harvard Dataverse, V1). I downloaded my sample from GWU which makes picking your criteria for the tweets much easier. You can make your own data set from all 40 million right [here](https://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/datasets).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a link to my exact sample: http://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/dataset/723265b8. You can also see my sample in the form of the tweet ids in my GitHub repo: [arjungandhi521/arjungandhi521.github.io/public_data/tweets_125k.txt](https://github.com/arjungandhi521/arjungandhi521.github.io/blob/main/public_data/tweet_ids_125k.txt). \n",
    "\n",
    "I sampled 125,000 of the 40 million tweets. The CSV I use directly below is private because of Twitter policy that one should not publish large amounts of tweets but that people in academics and such can go ahead and publish the tweet ids. As stated in the GWU link the data is from September 21, 2017 and May 17, 2019 and they had a gap in data collection from January 7, 2019 to April 17, 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to exclude retweets and this sample ranges from late 2017 to mid-2019 which is the full collection time. I excluded retweets because even though a tweet with 1 billion RTs may have high influence on Twitter, having it n times in the dataset is not really going to add to my understanding of the language. I still have access to the favorites and retweets data which I will use later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "To convert each tweet ID into the actual tweet data I am using Hydrator: Hydrator [Computer Software]. Retrieved from https://github.com/docnow/hydrator. From the above repo, I downloaded [version 0.0.13 of the app](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator/releases/tag/v0.0.13). I made a Twitter account to connect my account this Hydrator. When you download the sample just pick to download tweet ids. This will be a compressed .txt file. Just unzip it and then upload the file into Hydrator under \"Datasets\" in the desktop app. Then hit \"Add Dataset\" and then \"Start\" and then when its done you can click CSV to get the JSONL as a CSV. When I hydrated the tweets (turned them from tweet ids into tweets you see below), I started with 125,000 ids but the data frame directly below has less. This is for several reasons including people making their accounts private and deleted tweets and accounts. These tweet ids were put into the data set before these thing happend."

You can find a more in-depth explanation of tokenization here if you're so interested: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/05/what-is-tokenization-nlp/. Though I never explicity call something like tokenize(tweet), the preprocess function right here and the lemmatize later on are doing this.

What that basically means is I look at a set of tweets and then will make a matrix representation of these tweets as one. So every possible word in all the tweets will be the columns and the tweet ids will be my rows. Each row is a tweet. Every word in all the tweets gets a column. If tweet #10 has the word \"java\" 10 times then it will have a ten in that cell, if it has \"cowboy\" 0 times than it has a 0 there. Most cells will be 0 because there are LOTS of columns but only so many words one uses in any single tweet. I will then use these bags of words to make word clouds which will represent the bag of words with words on an image where the more a word is used, the bigger it is."

    "When looking at this graph one major thing to consider is that it may not be such a simple oh tweet length about climate must be going up year after year for a couple of reasons. One major factor is the sample from 2018 is much larger than the other two because the majority of data colleciton took place in 2018 and much of Jan-Apr 2019 lacked sampling. In 2019, GWU collected data the first week of January, not at all in Feb-Mar, the last two weeks of April, and most of May.\n",

It basically has many different decesion trees and they vote on the outcome. It is an easy to understand method for classification. By default it uses 100 trees and they have no max depth. You can learn more about decesion trees and random forests in these articles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest, https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2.

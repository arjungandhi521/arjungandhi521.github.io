    "In this project I will be looking at data from Twitter, specifically tweets collected by George Washing University from 2017 to 2019 with most data from 2018. I will be looking at things like what was the most common things talked about in relation to climate and what the sentiment was for the all these tweets, a specific time, etc. The goal here was to see can I look at some data and see oh I wonder if X event was happening at this time due to something like frequency of the tweet. I originally had in mind doing something like lets look at data from the time of Hurrican Irma and sentiment before and after in a conservative area in FL that was impacted and see if the hurricane caused a change in sentiment to climate change on Twitter. Because most tweets were not geotagged, I did not do this because it would be too difficult to do accurately here. So anyways, lets get started!"

    "# <center> Data Collection </center>\n",
    "I did not go and scrape Twitter to get all tweets that were on climate. Instead, I found a GWU dataset of climate change tweets that were collected from 2017-2019 (Littman, Justin; Wrubel, Laura, 2019, \"Climate Change Tweets Ids\", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5QCCUU, Harvard Dataverse, V1). I downloaded my sample from GWU which makes picking your criteria for the tweets much easier. You can make your own data set from all 40 million right [here](https://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/datasets).  Here is a link to my exact sample: http://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/dataset/a66e1b6b. You can also see my sample in the form of the tweet ids in my GitHub repo: [arjungandhi521/arjungandhi521.github.io/public_data/tweets_25k.txt](https://github.com/arjungandhi521/arjungandhi521.github.io/blob/main/public_data/tweets_25k.txt). I sampled 25,000 of the 40 million tweets. The CSV I use directly below is private because of Twitter policy that one should not publish large amounts of tweets but that people in academics and such can go ahead and publisht the tweet ids. As states in the above link the data is from September 21, 2017 and May 17, 2019 and they had a gap in data collection from January 7, 2019 to April 17, 2019. I chose to exclude retweets and this sample ranges from late 2017 to mid-2019 which is the full collection time. I excluded retweets because even though a tweet with 1 billion RTs may have high influence on Twitter, having it n times in the dataset is not really going to add to my understanding of the language. I still have access to the favorites and retweets data which I will use later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "To convert each tweet ID into the actual tweet data I am using Hydrator: Hydrator [Computer Software]. Retrieved from https://github.com/docnow/hydrator. From the above repo, I downloaded [version 0.0.13 of the app](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator/releases/tag/v0.0.13). I made a Twitter account to connect my account this Hydrator. When you download the sample just pick to download tweet ids. This will be a compressed .txt file. Just unzip it and then upload the file into Hydrator under \"Datasets\" in the desktop app. Then hit \"Add Dataset\" and then \"Start\" and then when its done you can click CSV to get the JSONL as a CSV. When I hydrated the tweets (turned them from tweet ids into tweets you see below), I started with 25,000 ids but the data frame directly below \"only\" has 18,328 tweets. This is for several reasons including people making their accounts private and deleted tweets and accounts. These tweet ids were put into the data set before these thing happend.\n",

Next, I am going to remove all links from these tweets because that is irrelvanet to the sentiment of the tweet. There are many things like this that I will do here then I will move on to make the tweets \"linguistically sound\" for analysis by doing things like removing words without meaning that won't contribute the analysis and then making all words their base word or lemmatizing them.\n",

    "#### Tokenization\n",
    "Tokenization a fundemental first step before you do anything in code with natural language to understand it. Tokenization is taking a piece of text like \"Python is the best\" and making into a list of the words that make up that text so here that would be [\"Python\", \"is\", \"the\", \"best\"]. You can find a more in-depth explanation of tokenization here if you're so interested: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/05/what-is-tokenization-nlp/. Though I never explicity call something like tokenize(tweet), the preprocess function right here and the lemmatize later on are doing this. The reasons I do this twice is I want to clean up the tweet before I lemmatize (explained later) and lemmatize needs a string not a string list."

One major factor is the sample from 2018 is much larger than the other two because the majority of data colleciton took place in 2018 and much of Jan-Apr 2019 lacked sampling. In 2019, GWU collected data the first week of January, not at all in Feb-Mar, the last two weeks of April, and most of May.\n",
